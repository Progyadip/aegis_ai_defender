🛡️ A.E.G.I.S AI Defender
Autonomous AI-Based Threat Detection & Elimination Engine to Block Ransomware and Zero-Day Attacks

🔍 Overview
A.E.G.I.S AI Defender is an advanced, real-time cybersecurity system that autonomously detects and mitigates ransomware and zero-day threats using a combination of machine learning, behavioral analysis, and deception techniques. It combines AI-driven detection with automated response mechanisms including quarantine, honeypot deployment, and system rollback to neutralize threats before they escalate.

🧠 Core Features
⚙️ Real-time System Monitoring – Tracks file I/O, process activity, and network behavior.

🧬 Feature Extraction Module – Extracts relevant features from telemetry data for AI analysis.
